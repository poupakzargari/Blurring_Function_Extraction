The project asks us to find the blurring function of the "heart.jpg" image. The project also specifies the length and width of the "plus" appeared in the right bottom corner of the image.
Having this information we can make a new image of a "plus", which is not blurred. Then crop the blurred plus and compare these two images for finding the blurring function H(u, v). Using
this blurring function and applying filters like "Wiener", "Inverse" and "Pseudo-inverse", we can extract the "heart.jpg" image with a better quality.
